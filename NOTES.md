# Project Notes

## Residential Rates

Charged on properties with a value of £40,000 or more.

Works like HMRC income tax, where tax is paid between bands.

E.g. a £300,000 property would pay 0% up to £145,000, 2% up to £250,000 then 5% on the remaining £50,000.

| Purchase Price    | Rate |
| ----------------- | ---- |
| Up to 145,000\*   | 0%   |
| 145,001 - 250,000 | 2%   |
| 250,001 - 325,000 | 5%   |
| 325,001 - 750,000 | 10%  |
| Over 750,000      | 12%  |

\*0% = nil rate band.
